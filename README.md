This is Luke Gessler's fork of
[**dictionary**](https://github.com/awatson1978/dictionary). 
This fork is updated for Meteor 1.2. (At the time of writing, **dictionary** is
a Meteor 0.6 app.)

Eventually this will be an adaptation of the dictionary app for interacting with
a corpus, such as
[HindMonoCorp](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11858/00-097C-0000-0023-6260-A). 
(A paper on the motivation behind this is forthcoming as of 17/10/2015--stay
tuned.)

### Installation

````sh
# Should be as simple as cloning the repository...

# And then running it...
meteor
